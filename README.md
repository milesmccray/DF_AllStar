**Dustforce Allstar Stats**

_Note: Program has to do ~12500 requests, so it will take a long time to generate (generate_allstar.py). allstar_stats.py uses the file generated to provide stats and give the output of one off allstars (one_off_levels.json)_

Calculates the # of allstars and 1-off allstars from http://dustkid.com leaderboards by parsing html. To run the program all you need is a json with the file structure _{Level_ID: {name: levelname, leaderboard: dustkid_link}}_.

See list of levels generated here (As of 6/15/24): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13hYtulDAyrH89BZDqAgOJellLWxvQPCBJg0VljBM5Rc/edit?gid=412952914#gid=412952914
